# Housing Agency in Boston MA Data Science Project

This project is part of the **IBM Data Science Professional Certification**. It involves analyzing housing data from the Boston, MA area using various data science techniques to extract insights, identify trends, and potentially guide decision-making for housing agencies.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize housing data to better understand the Boston housing market. It covers various aspects such as:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Data visualization to uncover trends and patterns.
- Predictive modeling to estimate housing prices.

## Key Features

- **Data Wrangling**: Cleaned and processed the dataset to remove inconsistencies and prepare it for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Conducted analysis to identify correlations between different variables such as location, size, and pricing.
- **Visualization**: Created visualizations to illustrate housing trends and market characteristics.
- **Predictive Model**: Built a predictive model to estimate housing prices based on the available data.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas**: Used for data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating predictive models.
